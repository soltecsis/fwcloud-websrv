- Verify that in the proxy `on error` event handler the `res.writeHead()` method is defined before calling it. If fwcloud-api is stopped in the middle of an API call processing, this event handler receives an `EPIPE` error (*This socket has been ended by the other party*) for the websocket and the `res` object doesn't has the `res.writeHead()` method defined. This was triggering a fatal error and the execution end of the fwcloud-websrv process.
